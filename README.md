# Day-4-Types-Of-Functions

**Function**

Function is named block of code that can be reused in order to excute the function we have to call the function using its name.

**Types of function**

1. Named function
2. Anonymous function
3. Arrow function
4. IIFE ->  Immediately invoked function expression

**Named Functions:** 
These are functions with a name. They can be defined in the global scope or inside another function.

**Anonymous Functions:**
These functions do not have a name and are often used as arguments to other functions or assigned to a variable.

**Arrow Functions:**
Introduced in ES6, arrow functions provide a concise syntax. They are anonymous and do not have their own this context.

**Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE):**
These functions are defined and invoked simultaneously. They are useful for creating a local scope to avoid polluting the global scope.

**Function Parameters and Arguments**
Functions can accept parameters and arguments to pass data. 
Parameters are defined in the function declaration, while arguments are the actual values passed to the function.

**Return Statement**
Functions can return a value using the return statement.

**Function Scope**
Functions have their own scope, meaning variables defined within a function are not accessible outside of it.
